	<h3>Personal Bio</h3>

		<p>I was born and grew up in New York City on the Upper West Side. I lived withmy mom, dad, brother Jamie and brother
		Paul. I started doing gymnastics recreationally and when I was 8 I joined a team. I stopped doing gymnastics right 
		before highschool started. </p>
	<h3>Work Experience</h3>
		<p> I started volunteering at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 9th grade and continued to do so through high school.
		Summer 2014 and 2015 I worked as a Pathology assistant, summer 2016 I worked there as a Session Assistant and then over this past summer I had
		an internship with a start up company and assisted a professor with research at the U of R. The internship focused on market research in order to gain insight for the company and the research focused on brand valuation.</p> 

	<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>I went to elementary school at P.S.6 which was located on the upper east side. Because I went to school on the east side I then had access to the other schools in the district so for
		middle school I went to East Side Middle. For highschool I went to Eleanor Roosevelt High School also located on the upper east side.
		I now attend the University of Rochester and I am majoring in business analytics and minoring in computer science with a focus on web design.</p>
