                <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born and grew up in New York City on the Upper West Side. I lived withmy mom, dad, brother Jamie and brother Paul. I started doing gymnastics recreationally and when I was 8 I joined a team. I stopped doing gymnastics right before highschool started.

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I started volunteering at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 9th grade and continued to do so through high school.
                    Summer 2014 and 2015 I worked as a Pathology assistant, summer 2016 I worked there as a Session Assistant and then over this past summer I had an internship with a start up company and assisted a professor with research at the U of R. The internship focused on market research in order to gain insight for the company and the research focused on brand valuation.
                </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I went to elementary school at P.S.6 which was located on the upper east side. Because I went to school on the east side I then had access to the other schools in the district so formiddle school I went to East Side Middle. For highschool I went to Eleanor Roosevelt High School also located on the upper east side. I now attend the University of Rochester and I am majoring in business analytics and minoring in computer science with a focus on web design.
