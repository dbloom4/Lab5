                            <p>
                                I am from Lindenhurst, New York. My parents are both immigrants. My father is from Cyprus and my mother is from Thailand. I also have one older sister. I enjoy playing video games and drawing in my free time. My favorite video game is the Dark Souls series. Right now, I am trying to beat Dark Souls 3. I also like cars. I have a Subaru BRZ.

                                I am currently a TA for Finance 204. I hold office hours twice a week as well as assist students by appointment. I am responsible for grading assingments and monitoring grades. For the past two summers, I worked with PJ Mechanical Corp. as an Assistant Project Manager Intern. The job site that I worked at was a new New York Presbyterian Hospital. I created about 150 Duck Leak Tests, participated in weekly commissioning meetings, completed forms related to the commissioning of equipment, and recorded daily construction reports.

                                I am currently a junior at the University of Rochester. I am studying Business with a concentration in Finance. I plan on completing a minor in math and computer science, hopefully. For high school, I went to Lindenhurst High School.
